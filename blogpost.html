          I found a love for me
          Darling just dive right in
          And follow my lead
          Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet
          I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
          'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
          Not knowing what it was
          I will not give you up this time
          But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
          And in your eyes you're holding mine
          Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
          Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
          When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
          But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
          Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
          She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
          I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
          To carry love, to carry…
